My notes on topics related to Access Control

Access Control => Who has access (individual users or groups of users or users outside the context boundary/organization), access to what resources, type of access (view/read, edit/write, act/execute) and mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access    

Q. Why is Access Control important?   
A. A misconfigured application, server, infrastructure management set up can expose personal information of users, credentials, confidential artifacts, critical infrastructure resources to public. This misconfiguration can be abused to access data, for monitory gains, espionage, etc.

Context-Based Access Control brings dynamic features to create rules to allow access to resources or workflows or pages.    

e.g. Let say, a role does not require (or should not have) access to a workflow or page all the time. However, based on specific custom rules when a timer expires or threshold is breached, now one role gets access to the workflow or page to take action.    

Auto-Escalation in workflows can leverage CBAC to define access control in levels or hierarchy.    
Another analogy is Conditional Call Forwarding in mobile provisioning to send escalation or call based on timer expiry for un-answered calls. This can be used in SLA-bound service support systems in real world banking, telco, electronic fund transfer, trading, and safety platforms.
