My notes on topics related to Access Control

Access Control => Who has access (individual users or groups of users or users outside the context boundary/organization), access to what resources, type of access (view/read, edit/write, act/execute) and mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access    

Q. Why is Access Control important?   
A. A misconfigured application, server, infrastructure management set up can expose personal information of users, credentials, confidential artifacts, critical infrastructure resources to public. This misconfiguration can be abused to access data, for monitory gains, espionage, etc.
